# Assessing-the-effect-of-the-child-support-grant-in-reducing-child-hunger-in-South-Africa

This research paper was completed in fulfillment of my Economics Honours degree as part of ECO4021W(Research and writing course). What follows is a brief overview of the findings of the paper, I received a final mark of 73% for the paper. The Child Grant Policy was introduced in South Africa during 1998 and currently aids over
12 million beneficiaries. It is crucial to assess the effectiveness of such a widely received
wealth redistribution tool, especially in a country plagued with extreme levels of poverty and
inequality. Using NIDS-CRAM wave 1 and wave 2 data collected in 2020, this paper sought
to evaluate the impact of the CSG on the likelihood or the incidence of child hunger in South
Africa. It was found that there is a significant negative impact of the receipt of CSG on the
incidence of child hunger in wave 1, which is in line with theoretical expectations, wave 2
however, showed the impact is less significant and is positive, which suggests - ceteris
paribus - that the receipt of the CSG did not significantly alleviate child hunger
